# Disease Prediction Project
A Disease Prediction tool to easily detect the problem that a person is facing by analyzing the symptoms. It works on Decision Tree and Neural Network created using Keras. Web implementation remaining.

## Model Metrics
* Accuracy: 99/8%
* Validation Accuracy: 100%
* Loss: 1.5%
* Validation Loss: 1.0%

## Steps to Run
1. Train the model by running all the cells in `DiseasePredictionTraining.ipynb`.


## Dataset
* Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning Dataset
    
    Complete Dataset consists of 2 CSV files . One of them is training and other is for testing your model. Each CSV file has 133 columns. 132 of these columns are symptoms that a person experiences and last column is the prognosis. These symptoms are mapped to 42 diseases you can classify these set of symptoms to.
